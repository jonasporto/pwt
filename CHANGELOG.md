## [0.1.10] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **Description in create**: `pwt create TICKET "auth login bug"` - quoted text with spaces is auto-detected as description

  - `pwt meta description` - get description of current worktree
  - `pwt meta description "my task"` - set description of current worktree
